# Personal projects

- This blog :tada:  
  `Jekyll` `github-pages` `Liquid`

  Built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted at [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
  The first revision was something I decided to build almost from scratch using mdl-lite. After the deprecation of that library I decided to move to something minimal and with even less maintenance involved.

- [Syncstart](http://syncstart.herokuapp.com)  
  `NodeJs` `socket.io`  

  A simple NodeJS web application that syncs a timer between 2 clients.  
  Netflix &.. need to hit play at the same second?

- Home automation  
  `Raspberry Pi` `C.H.I.P.` `NodeJS`

  A Raspberry Pi, one C.H.I.P., a couple of ESP8266 and a lot of sensors. I can control different lights, open the garage door, blast with IR TV/Audio surround and monitor temperature and security cameras. Everything is bridged to Siri and “custom made”, so I can control the system with voice commands.

- [Hello Kiwi](https://github.com/mcomisso/hellokiwi)  
  `Objective-C` `Swift` `Django`

  A simple iOS application built around iBeacon technology, for the [Kiwi team](http://exmachina.porscheitalia.com/ita/team-scheda/kiwi-1).  
  Was built for the [Ex-Machina camp](http://www.h-farm.com/porsche-italia-lancia-il-progetto-ex-machina/) of _H-farm Ventures_, to present and demonstrate the iBeacon technology to the public.  
  Backend hosted on parse.com.
