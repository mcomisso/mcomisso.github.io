# Working experience

**[VOUCHERCODES.CO.UK](https://vouchercodes.co.uk), LONDON[JUL 3, 2017 — CURRENT]**  
`swift` `objective-c` `xcode server` `jenkins`   
I am currently in charge of the development of VoucherCodes.co.uk app, working in a mixed Swift/ObjC codebase as a iOS engineer. I am part of the mobile team, implementing business requirements in the main iOS application, while porting code to Swift and implementing good engineering practices with tests and CI.

**[FREELANCE, IOS DEVELOPER]() [MAY 17, 2015 —SEP 2017]**  
`swift` `objective-c` `python` `angularJS` `jenkins`   
I worked with various companies, focusing mainly on adding functionalities to their products or speed up a project. 

_A few_

- [EVERSNAP INC.](https://eversnappro.com), BAY AREA, CALIFORNIA (remote) [MAY 2016 - APR 2017]  
Eversnap is a startup focused on saving memories from both private and business events. I was keeping track of the iOS application, maintaing legacy code and writing new features to push forward the business.

- [H-UMUS S.R.L.](http://h-umus.it), VENICE, ITALY [APR 2015 - APR 2016]  
I worked with H-umus for almost a year, working daily with the internal development team to build new functionalities around their iOS applications, Otto and Nuxie.

- [BLUE-MATE (H-FARM)](http://h-farm.com), VENICE, ITALY [FEB 2014 — APR 2015]  
Main developer and Co-Founder. I was in charge of choosing the technology stack used to build our product/solution: a digital menu for restaurants, involving iBeacons. I personally built both the web application and the iOS application/SDK.

# Personal projects

- This blog :tada:

  Built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted at [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
  The first revision was something I decided to build almost from scratch using mdl-lite. After the deprecation of that library I decided to move to something minimal and with even less maintenance involved.

- Home automation:

  Smart Home: A Raspberry Pi, one C.H.I.P., a couple of ESP8266 and a lot of sensors. I can control different lights, open the garage door, blast with IR TV/Audio surround and monitor temperature and security cameras. Everything is bridged to Siri and “custom made”, so I can control the system with voice commands.

- [Hello Kiwi](https://github.com/mcomisso/hellokiwi)

  A simple iOS application built around iBeacon technology, for the [Kiwi team](http://exmachina.porscheitalia.com/ita/team-scheda/kiwi-1).  
  Was built for the [Ex-Machina camp](http://www.h-farm.com/porsche-italia-lancia-il-progetto-ex-machina/) of _H-farm Ventures_, to present and demonstrate the iBeacon technology to the public.  
  Backend hosted on parse.com.
