### A new adventure begin

I'm listening to Nirvana's _I'm on a plane_. By a month from today, I will probably be in San Jos√®, near San Francisco, one of my biggest dream in life. I always looked with shiny eyes that part of the world, thinking about all the stories I heard of the Silicon Valley.  

I will leave for just 4 months, but I hope they will have a big impact on me, on my connections and my job (and on my english).
