# My Vinyls: A month(s) in review

TL;DR
The first month: 
- my profit was a honest 4.97 GBP.
- The app was downloaded 

Did you hear? *Vinyly* is now *My Vinyls*! 
This is an app that I've had on the store for free for the last couple of years, and last year the following crazy ideas got in my mind: what if I start treating my side project as a proper product? What if I set my goal to be the best *app of choice* there is in the store?

In this unknown lenght of a post I want to cover the followings:
- What is My Vinyls?
- Lessons learned
- What went wrong
- Costs and gains

## What is My Vinyls?

> My Vinyls is the app that closes the gap between your phisical and digital records.

No but seriously?

Ok, My Vinyls is a Discogs client, but lets you search for records via audio, barcode scanning or text input. It also add a play button to your records for when you want to play it on Spotify or Apple Music. Also, widgets.

## Lesson learned

- ### Marketing
Reddit: 
You've earned £100 in Ad Credit

Meta: 
£20 credit after you spend £20
Definitely the most cheap impressions, but I feel not many customers were brought in by it. 
Having some posts boosted made it easy to increase the followers count, which might help moving the word out when more features will be available. 
It currently sits at around 100 followers (https://www.instagram.com/myvinylsapp/).

AppStore: 
Given up - too complex, no credits. The best bet is to do an amazing job showcasing Apple's technologies, which they might end up putting you on a list or even features for the day. Just being on a list in the first #10 positions gives a 10x on downloads.
The app was featured for a few days in a decent amount of stores, and helped so so much.

ProductHunt:
Overhyped. Was good to get the word out, but it did not help much with either sales or downloads. 
Also ⚠️  spam! It seems there are some "sharks" on Product Hunt that simply comment on new releases, to offer their own services. I've declined (read: not replied) to a few that came straight into my mailbox.
Still - it's free - use it and put it in your cv? :)

Mastodon:
Just love for this one. I've actually learnt a lot from other developers, interacted with customers and users, and overall has always been pleasant experience. It's very likely that I would have had way less conversations on Twitter than on this website.

- ### Be kind
This extends to everything. Be kind to yourself, to your immediate circle, to your customers. The best thing that can I am always so grateful a user.

- ### Yes, people will be interested
 I really did not have much expectations in terms of user interests, but I was proven wrong very quickly. It's really great to receive emails from customers: simply questions, feedbacks and support requests. Seeing the questions helped me massively in shaping the future decisions for My Vinyls.
  I am trying to build up a smaller, private community of those that are willing to send a suggestion: The best product I found for this task is Fider, which I've setup on a Digitalocean droplet.

- ### Make baby steps
  There will always be one more thing that prevents you from shipping something. Just do it ™. Iterations with your own customers will bring much more value than initially expected, and the best way to tackle is to focus on one at each minor release.
  I was a big believer of the Spotify playback button - mostly because "it was cool"


## What went wrong

Let's start with the launch!
I've submitted the application without noticing my subscriptions had been in review for more than a month. Needless to say, the app went live with no subscriptions available (but people started purchasing the fully unlocked version).
I would like to see My Vinyls growing slowly and steadily with subscriptions.

**Tales of a revenue**

When the first purchase notification came I quietly panicked. 

The idea of a *user* becoming a **CUSTOMER** changes a lot the dynamics of what's happening in your relationship with who uses your apps. 

## Costs and gains

The juicy bits you've been waiting for.

Let's put some download numbers first

The first month of My Vinyls through the AppStore, thanks to the featuring for a few days, it generated 138.34 GBP. 
I've spent 133.37 GBP on the first month, although some expenses will amortise over the course of a year (like the apple subscription)

| **Total**        | **133.37 GBP**               | **4.30 GBP**  |           |

A few things I've realized:
- AppFigures is great, but I really only wanted to know when the app gets featured. For this specific use case, you can use AppFollow.io, which gives you the same functionality for free. (although AppFigures seems to have a better AppStore observability)
- Reddit was

# Cool, but who are you?

My first job in the industry was as a *wannabe* startup founder. Depending how you see it we went decently far or nowhere, but the time I've spent dealing with everything that a small company needs to deal with shaped and defined me much more than any academic studies - which I dropped out from. 
I am now a seasoned iOS developer, with a few companies of increasingly larger complexities in my cv. Currently I work at Skyscanner.
