### Every day is christmas if you work in IT.
Just setup a couple of feed with the right sources and enjoy the flow of continuous innovation, tools, etc.  

But actually these days how many things you should know to stay on top of everything?  I personally love coding with xcode and trying around new tools for web development, but I'd like to explode this situation.

### Let's start with Xcode.

You open your mac, with that feeling of fresh and recharged ideas, ready to start a new project. Open Xcode. Setup. Unit test, UI test, universal. Blinking cursor.

But hey, no cocoapods, no party.

`gem install cocoapods`, thaks to [rvm]() sudo-less.

A `pod init && nano Podfile` later, you just fill it with the most useful and common libraries (depending by the project).
