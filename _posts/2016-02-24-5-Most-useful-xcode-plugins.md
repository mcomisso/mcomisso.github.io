## A quick list of super-useful plugins for Xcode.
<!--more-->

#### [Alcatraz <i class="fa fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/alcatraz/Alcatraz)

Well, this is essential. Simplifies a lot the install/uninstall passage for almost any other plugin or extension.  
Download it by pasting this line into a new terminal window:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/supermarin/Alcatraz/deploy/Scripts/install.sh | sh
```

#### [GitDiff <i class="fa fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/johnno1962/GitDiff)

Highlights every line has changed since the last commit. It is also possible to reset the highlighted lines or just find out what was written there before the editing.

#### [VVDocumenter-Xcode <i class="fa fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/onevcat/VVDocumenter-Xcode)

Keeping your code documented? So annoying without this.  
Just enter `///` over one of your classes, methods definition, variables to get the Xcode supported documented section.

#### [KSImageNamed <i class="fa fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/ksuther/KSImageNamed-Xcode)

How many times do you forget about the name of that image in xcassets?  
With KSImageNamed you get for free a list + preview of the stored images. Just start typing `[UIImage imageNamed]`.

#### [Autoindent with save <i class="fa fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/ThilinaHewagama/AutoIndentWithSave)

If you get annoyed by not having code correctly indented, this is the right plugin to install.  
It checks and re-indent all the code every time you press `cmd + S`.
