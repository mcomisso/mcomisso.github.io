### MVC
**Model View Controller**

This is the most used and abused pattern in mobile development.  
Can be applied to a plethora of projects, but can easily become a nightmare, also known as **Massive View Controller**.

|Model | View | Controller|
|------|------|-----------|
|Determine the state of the data  | Determine where the data is represented | Determine how the view and the model should comunicate.  |


### MVVM
**Model View ViewModel (Controller)**

The _Controller_ is actually implicit.  
The code maintenance is helped by the new ViewModel entity, which keeps the actual logic to fetch the code from the model. In this way, 

|Model | View | ViewModel |
|------|------|-----------|
|Determine the state of the data | Determine where the data is represented |

|View | Interactor | Presenter | Entity | Router |
