Blue-mate was a project we started in February 2014.  
We were chosen by [H-Farm Ventures](http://www.h-farm.com/) to attend the 3 months H-Camp acceleration camp.

### Tech

[The iOS source code is available on github](https://github.com/mcomisso/BMDigitalMenu).

- iOS Client framework:
  There's a bunch of libraries included, more on project page.

- Backend:  
  Initially on Parse.com, we moved on Google Apps Engine with a Django backend.

### Background

The initial team was Edoardo Capaldo (graphic designer and business), Vincenzo Marco Palmieri(graphic designer and social management) and me(developer).

We successfully developed an iOS framework activated by iBeacon signal.  
By entering its area, our application magically comes back to live and presents relevant information to the active user.
