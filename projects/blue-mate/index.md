Blue-mate was a project we started in February 2014.  
We were chosen by [H-Farm Ventures](http://www.h-farm.com/) to attend the 3 months H-Camp acceleration camp.

### Story

The initial team was Edoardo Capaldo (graphic designer and business), Vincenzo Marco Palmieri(graphic designer and social management) and me(developer).

We successfully developed an iOS framework activated by iBeacon signal.  
By entering its area, our application magically comes back to live and presents relevant information to the active user.

### Tech

The code was a custom iOS framwork for iOS 7, when we decided to stop and release the code under GPL attribution.
